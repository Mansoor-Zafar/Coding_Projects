This is a simple (WIP) maze game where the player will enter their movements with (WASD) 
<br>They will traverse through the maze until they reach the goals marked by 'x'
<br>They can choose any character to be their icon
<br>The maze will be set by the player but must be atleast 3x3

<br>Example:<br>
